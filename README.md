# 🎯 Cracking Hashes

First, note that I've created a comprehensive and detailed Notion's guide of Hashcat that I suggest to you if you're interested in understading the fundamentals of hashing. It is called [Intro to Hashcat - Making & Cracking Hashes](https://bold-top-b0e.notion.site/Intro-to-Hashcat-making-cracking-hashes-1e2d8ff66ad2808c910fd25b868c9840?pvs=4). 

## 📝 Description
In this project, I gained hands-on experience with hashing techniques and password cracking using tools such as Hashcat , John the Ripper , and hashid . I generated hashes using multiple algorithms (MD5, SHA-256, bcrypt, SHA-512crypt), analyzed hash formats, and performed dictionary attacks to simulate real-world password recovery scenarios.

## 🎯 Objective
This lab aimed to build foundational knowledge in password security, improve technical documentation skills, and develop a structured approach to using cybersecurity tools effectively in both offensive and defensive contexts.

### Tools Used

- Notion – For deep documentation
- Kali Linux
- Hashcat
- John the Ripper (JtR)
- Tools to identify hash types based on format
- Tools to generate hashes
- rockyou.txt wordlist for dictionary attacks

### Skills Learned
- Generated hashes using multiple algorithms
- Identified hash types
- Cracking hashes
- Understood how salts affect hash uniqueness
- Improved Python one-liners and Linux commands
- Documented technical processes clearly and systematically
