# 🎯 Cracking Hashes

## 📝 Description
Here we will create hashes and then we will crack them just like if it was some stolen passwords.

## 🎯 Objective
This lab aime to build foundational knowledge in password security, improve technical documentation skills, and develop a structured approach to using cybersecurity tools effectively in both offensive and defensive contexts.

### Tools Used

- Notion – For deep documentation
- Kali Linux
- Hashcat
- Tools to identify hash types based on format
- Tools to generate hashes
- rockyou.txt wordlist for dictionary attacks

### Skills Learned
- Generated hashes using multiple algorithms
- Identified hash types
- Cracking hashes
- Understood how salts affect hash uniqueness
- Improved Python one-liners and Linux commands
- Documented technical processes clearly and systematically
