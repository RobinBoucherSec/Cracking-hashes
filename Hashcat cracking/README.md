# 🎯 Hashcat cracking in Kali Linux

See here the detailed version on Nortion. It is called [Generating Hashes in Kali Linux](https://bold-top-b0e.notion.site/Generating-Hashes-in-Kali-Linux-1e2d8ff66ad28018b06fd12cdaca6c06). 

## 📝 Description
In this project, I gained hands-on experience with hashing techniques and password cracking using tools such as Hashcat , John the Ripper , and hashid . I generated hashes using multiple algorithms (MD5, SHA-256, bcrypt, SHA-512crypt), analyzed hash formats, and performed dictionary attacks to simulate real-world password recovery scenarios.

## 🎯 Objective
This lab aimed to build foundational knowledge in password security, improve technical documentation skills, and develop a structured approach to using cybersecurity tools effectively in both offensive and defensive contexts.

### Tools Used

- Notion – For deep documentation
- Kali Linux – For penetration testing and command-line operations
- Hashcat – Advanced password recovery tool for GPU-based hash cracking
- John the Ripper (JtR) – Fast, CPU-based password cracker
- hashid – Tool to identify hash types based on format
- rockyou.txt – Popular wordlist for dictionary attacks
- Python 3 + bcrypt – For generating salted bcrypt hashes
- mkpasswd – Utility for generating SHA-512crypt hashes
- md5sum / sha256sum – Utilities for generating fast hashes
- Online tools – Such as hashes.com for hash identification and decryption attempts

### Skills Learned
- Generated hashes using multiple algorithms: MD5 , SHA-256 , bcrypt , and SHA-512crypt
- Identified hash types by analyzing prefixes ($2b$, $6$, etc.) using hashid and online tools
- Cracked hashes using dictionary attacks with Hashcat and John the Ripper
- Understood how salts affect hash uniqueness in bcrypt and SHA-512crypt
- Practiced troubleshooting common issues like extra characters in hash files and compressed wordlists
- Improved terminal and scripting skills using Python one-liners and Linux commands
- Gained awareness of password security and the importance of strong authentication practices
- Documented technical processes clearly and systematically
